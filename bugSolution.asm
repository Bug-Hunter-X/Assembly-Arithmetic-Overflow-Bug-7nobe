```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a large value into AX
cmp bx, 0FFFFh - ax ; Check for potential overflow
jo overflow_handler ; Jump to overflow handler if overflow is detected
add ax, bx ; Add the value in BX to AX
jmp end_addition

overflow_handler:
; Handle overflow appropriately (e.g., set an error flag, display a message)
; ...
end_addition:
```
This improved version uses a `cmp` instruction to compare the potential sum with the maximum possible value. The `jo` (jump on overflow) instruction branches to an overflow handler if an overflow is detected, preventing incorrect results.  The overflow handler would contain the appropriate error handling steps.
